# Machine_Learning_for_Chemical_Engineering

The aim of this project is to predict surface tension for ionic liquids (ILs) as a function of temperature and molecular descriptors. The data set is taken from journal paper and molecular descriptors were added by us using the RDKit toolkit. 
There are total eight tasks following:
