The aim of this project is to predict surface tension for ionic liquids (ILs) as a function of temperature and molecular descriptors. The data set is taken from journal paper and molecular descriptors were added by us using the RDKit toolkit. 
There are total eight tasks following:
# Task 1: Plot surface tension vs. temperature for one IL.
# Task 2: Predict surface tension from temperature for this IL using polynomial regression.
# Task 3: Train a Gaussian process regression to predict the surface tension from temperature for this IL. 
# Task 4: Now perform data splitting for the entire data set. 
# Task 5: Performs feature selection for predicting surface tension.
# Task 6: Perform k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression to predict surface tension.
# Task 7: Train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict surface tension. 
# Task 8: Perform hyperparameter optimization for an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict surface tension. Vary at least three hyperparameters. Evaluate each model's performance. Choose your best model and report its performance.
